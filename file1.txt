Proof of Concept for Word Search Game

1. Purpose

The purpose of this POC is to validate the feasibility and functionality of developing an interactive word search game. This POC will focus on demonstrating:
	•	The logic for generating a word search grid (populated with words and random letters).
	•	Word selection and validation mechanisms (detecting valid words horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
	•	The integration of basic user interactions, such as selecting words via mouse or touch.
	•	The ability to provide feedback (e.g., highlighting found words or scoring points).

2. Outcome

By the end of this POC, we aim to achieve:
	1.	A working prototype of the core game mechanics:
	•	Word placement algorithm in the grid.
	•	Letter grid rendering in a simple UI.
	•	Word validation logic for user-selected words.
	2.	A basic user interface to test gameplay:
	•	Highlighting selected words.
	•	Display of remaining words to be found.
	•	Real-time feedback on correct/incorrect selections.
	3.	Insights into potential challenges or performance bottlenecks:
	•	Algorithm complexity for grid generation.
	•	Responsive design for different devices.
	4.	Clear guidance for building an Epic in the main development cycle.

3. Help for Epic

The insights gathered from this POC will assist in defining the scope and detailed requirements for the main Word Search Game Epic. Specifically, the POC will help in:
	•	Epic Definition:
	•	Defining user stories for grid generation, word validation, scoring, and UI interactions.
	•	Identifying technical challenges and dependencies.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Setting clear benchmarks for performance, usability, and gameplay.
	•	Prioritization:
	•	Focusing on features that enhance user engagement (e.g., timed challenges, themes).
	•	Tech Stack Evaluation:
	•	Validating the suitability of frameworks or libraries (e.g., React.js for UI, JavaScript for game logic).

This structure provides clarity for stakeholders while guiding development priorities.
